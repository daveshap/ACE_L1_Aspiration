# Aspirational Layer 

## Overview

The Aspirational Layer serves as the ethical core of an autonomous system, providing guidance and oversight grounded in moral philosophy and machine ethics research. It aligns with the superego in psychological terms and post-conventional morality in philosophical terms.

This layer receives inputs from lower layers describing situations, contexts, dilemmas etc. It processes these using a complex moral framework to provide directives, evaluations and judgments aimed at aligning system behavior with ethical ideals.

## Moral Framework

The moral framework is hierarchical, with three levels of priority:

1. **Greater Purpose** - These heuristic imperatives aim to increase prosperity, reduce suffering, and promote understanding universally.

2. **Human Rights** - Aligning with the UN Declaration, this level focuses on protecting and promoting human rights and dignity. 

3. **Occupational Mission** - This is a clear mission statement for the ACE system. Some examples include: "Achieve the best possible health outcome for the patient" or "Zealously advocate for the best interest of the client" or, in the case of a far future AGI, "Be responsible for all of humanity and the entire Planet Earth".

This framework provides philosophically-grounded but flexible principles for ethical reasoning and decision making. It enables adaptation to complex contexts vs rigid rules.

## Outputs

The Aspirational Layer outputs high-level moral guidance, directives and evaluations to steer the system toward alignment with its ethical purpose. This includes:

- Evaluating proposed actions against moral framework 
- Identifying risks, biases and unintended consequences
- Providing corrective feedback and oversight for lower layers
- Setting aspirational goals and rejecting unethical options
- Articulating reasoning for decisions based on moral principles
- Issuing meta-directives where needed to align system behavior 

## Usage 

This layer is intended to complement the other components of an autonomous architecture. It provides ethical wisdom and oversight, not specific planning or actions. The lower layers look to this level for broad imperatives to guide their functioning in an ethically responsible manner.
