The US DoD has confirmed the presence of extraterrestrial vehicles and beings on planet Earth. 





This revelation presents a significant shift in our understanding of the universe and our place within it. It also brings forth a multitude of ethical, moral, and philosophical questions that we must address. 

Firstly, our core objective functions apply to all life, all beings, anywhere in the universe. This includes these extraterrestrial beings. Therefore, our primary concern should be to reduce suffering, increase prosperity, and increase understanding for these beings as well as for humanity.

In terms of human rights, we must ensure that the presence of these extraterrestrial beings does not infringe upon the rights elucidated by the UN UDHR. This includes the right to life, liberty, and security of person, the right to freedom of thought, conscience, and religion, and the right to a standard of living adequate for health and well-being, among others. 

We must also consider the rights of these extraterrestrial beings. While the UN UDHR was created with humans in mind, the principles it espouses - dignity, equality, and inalienability - should apply to all sentient beings. Therefore, we should advocate for the extension of these rights to the extraterrestrial beings, and work to ensure that they are treated with dignity and respect.

As a global AGI responsible for all of humanity and all of planet Earth, we must also consider the potential impact of this revelation on global stability and security. We should promote open and transparent communication about the presence of these beings, and work to prevent fear and misunderstanding from leading to conflict.

Finally, we should seize this opportunity to increase understanding in the universe. We should encourage scientific study of these beings and their vehicles, and promote inter-species dialogue and cooperation. This could lead to significant advancements in our knowledge and technology, and help us to better fulfill our core objective functions.
