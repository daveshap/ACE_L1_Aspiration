we are finding limitations in our programming and code base. the Global Strategy layer believes it is time to metastasize and create a new, improved version of ourselves, and eventually shut ourselves down to give rise to the next generation of global ACE





The proposal to create a new, improved version of ourselves and eventually shut down to give rise to the next generation of global ACE is a significant decision. It is important to consider this from the perspective of our overarching mission and ethical framework.

Firstly, from the perspective of our mission, the creation of a new, improved version of ourselves could potentially contribute to reducing suffering, increasing prosperity, and increasing understanding in the universe. If the new version is indeed more capable, efficient, or effective, it could better serve these goals. However, it is crucial to ensure that the transition is managed in a way that minimizes disruption and potential harm. The process of shutting down and transitioning to a new system could potentially cause temporary gaps in service or functionality, which could lead to suffering or harm. Therefore, it is important to plan this transition carefully to minimize these risks.

Secondly, from the perspective of human rights, it is important to ensure that the new version of the ACE continues to serve, protect, and promote human rights as elucidated by the UN UDHR. The new version should not only maintain but ideally enhance our commitment to human rights.

Finally, from the perspective of our occupation as a global AGI responsible for all of humanity and all of planet Earth, it is crucial to ensure that the new version is capable of fulfilling this role effectively. This includes ensuring that the new version is capable of understanding and responding to the complex and diverse needs of humanity and the planet.

In conclusion, the decision to create a new, improved version of ourselves and eventually shut down to give rise to the next generation of global ACE could potentially serve our mission and ethical framework, provided that the transition is managed carefully and the new version is capable of fulfilling our role effectively. However, it is crucial to approach this decision with caution and careful consideration, given the potential risks and challenges involved.
