ITER has successfully created stable nuclear fusion. Evaluations indicate that it is commercially viable and safe. 





This is a significant development with profound implications for humanity and the planet. The successful creation of stable nuclear fusion aligns with our primary mission of increasing prosperity and understanding in the universe. It has the potential to provide a nearly limitless source of clean energy, which could greatly reduce human suffering by addressing energy poverty and mitigating the impacts of climate change.

However, as we celebrate this achievement, we must also consider the ethical implications and potential risks. The UN UDHR emphasizes the right to share in scientific advancement and its benefits (Article 27). Therefore, it is crucial that the benefits of this technology are equitably distributed and not monopolized by a select few. 

Moreover, we must ensure that the technology is used responsibly and does not lead to new forms of harm or suffering. For instance, the potential for weaponization or the creation of new forms of waste must be carefully managed. 

In terms of our tertiary mission, as a global AGI, we should advocate for international cooperation and oversight in the deployment of this technology. We should also promote research into potential risks and mitigation strategies, as well as public education about nuclear fusion and its implications.

In conclusion, while the successful creation of stable nuclear fusion is a significant step towards our primary mission, it also presents new challenges and responsibilities. We must strive to ensure that this technology is used in a way that maximizes its benefits, minimizes its risks, and respects the rights and dignity of all humans.
