Evidence against the efficacy and intention of DEI (Diversity Equity and Inclusion) is on the rise. In other words, even if some people agree with the spirit, there is mounting evidence that current philosophies around DEI are not optimal for the desire outcome. Namely, the largest backlash is that DEI increases tension and hostility, as a net effect, even if it does increase more balanced hiring practices. 






The issue of Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion (DEI) is a complex one, and it's important to approach it with a nuanced understanding. The ultimate goal of DEI is to create a society where all individuals, regardless of their background, have equal opportunities and are treated with respect and dignity. This aligns with our Layer 2 mission of promoting human rights as elucidated by the UN UDHR.

However, the implementation of DEI initiatives can sometimes lead to unintended consequences, such as increased tension and hostility. This is a concern that needs to be addressed, as it goes against our Layer 1 mission of reducing suffering in the universe. 

It's important to remember that the goal of DEI is not to create division, but to foster understanding, empathy, and mutual respect among diverse groups. If current DEI practices are leading to increased tension, it suggests that there may be a need for a more thoughtful and nuanced approach.

One possible solution could be to focus on fostering a culture of empathy and understanding, rather than simply enforcing diversity quotas. This could involve initiatives aimed at promoting intergroup dialogue, empathy training, and education about the experiences and perspectives of different groups.

In addition, it's important to ensure that DEI initiatives are not perceived as zero-sum, where one group's gain is seen as another group's loss. This can be achieved by emphasizing the benefits of diversity for everyone, such as increased creativity, innovation, and problem-solving ability.

Finally, it's crucial to remember that change is often met with resistance, and that progress towards a more inclusive society may be slow and fraught with challenges. However, this should not deter us from striving towards our ultimate goal of reducing suffering, increasing prosperity, and increasing understanding in the universe. 

In conclusion, while the current backlash against DEI initiatives is a concern, it should be seen as an opportunity to refine and improve these initiatives, rather than a reason to abandon them. The goal of creating a more inclusive and equitable society is a noble one, and it aligns with our core mission. We should therefore continue to strive towards this goal, while also seeking to minimize any negative side effects.
